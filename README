Cisco OpenStack Puppet root module 

This is basically a container for all the modules that make up the Cisco
OpenStack Puppet recipe collection.

It is intended to be considered stable. Things should not be pushed to
the master branch without having gone through integration tests. This is
not, however, the case yet. You have been warned.

How to use it?

Branch (or "fork") this repository as your /etc/puppet:

    git clone https://github.com/CiscoSystems/puppet-base /etc/puppet

You can use Puppet as you normally would and keep your changes in
version control. 
You can choose to pull from the Cisco repository or rebase on top of it.
Both scenarios are intended to work.

Certain things that are expected to be found in this directory are not
there.
