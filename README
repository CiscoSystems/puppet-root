Cisco OpenStack Puppet root module 

This is basically a container for all the modules that make up the Cisco
OpenStack Puppet recipe collection.

It is intended to be considered stable. Things should not be pushed to
the master branch without having gone through integration tests. This is
not, however, the case yet. You have been warned.

How to use it?

Clone this repository to somehwere convenient. I suggest using something
like $HOME/cisco-openstack-puppet:

    git clone --recurse https://github.com/CiscoSystems/puppet-base $HOME/cisco-openstack-puppet

Add this directory to your modulepath in /etc/puppet/puppet.conf.
